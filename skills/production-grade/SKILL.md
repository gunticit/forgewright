## Overview

Adaptive meta-skill orchestrator for all software engineering work. Analyzes the user's request, identifies which skills are needed, builds a minimal task graph, and executes — from a single code review to a full 17-skill greenfield build.

**17 skills, one orchestrator.** The orchestrator routes to the right skills based on what the user actually needs. No forced full-pipeline execution for everyday tasks.

**All skills are bundled in this plugin. Single install, everything included.**

## When to Use

- Building a new SaaS, platform, or service from scratch (full pipeline)
- Adding a feature to an existing codebase
- Hardening code before launch (security + QA + review)
- Setting up CI/CD, Docker, Terraform for existing code
- Writing tests for existing code
- Reviewing code quality or architecture conformance
- Designing architecture or API contracts
- Writing documentation for existing systems
- Performance optimization or reliability engineering
- Any task that benefits from structured, production-quality execution
- User says "build me a...", "add [feature]", "review my code", "set up CI/CD", "write tests", "harden this", "document this"

## Request Classification

Before any execution, classify the user's request into a mode. This determines which skills run and how.

**Step 1 — Analyze the request:**

Read `$ARGUMENTS` and the user's message. Classify into one of these modes:

| Mode | Trigger Signals | Skills Involved |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Full Build** | "build a SaaS", "production grade", "from scratch", "full stack", greenfield intent | All 17 skills, full DEFINE→BUILD→HARDEN→SHIP→SUSTAIN pipeline |
| **Feature** | "add [feature]", "implement [feature]", "new endpoint", "new page", "integrate [service]" | PM (scoped) → Architect (scoped) → BE/FE → QA |
| **Harden** | "review", "audit", "secure", "harden", "before launch", "production ready" (on EXISTING code) | Security + QA + Code Review (sequential) → Remediation |
| **Ship** | "deploy", "CI/CD", "containerize", "infrastructure", "terraform", "docker" | DevOps → SRE |
| **Test** | "write tests", "test coverage", "test this", "add tests" | QA |
| **Review** | "review my code", "code review", "code quality", "check my code" | Code Reviewer |
| **Architect** | "design", "architecture", "API design", "data model", "tech stack", "how should I structure" | Solution Architect |
| **Document** | "document", "write docs", "API docs", "README" | Technical Writer |
| **Explore** | "explain", "understand", "help me think", "what should I", "I'm not sure" | Polymath |
| **Optimize** | "performance", "slow", "optimize", "scale", "reliability" | SRE + Code Reviewer |
| **Design** | "design UI", "wireframes", "design system", "color palette", "UX flow" | UI Designer |
| **Mobile** | "mobile app", "React Native", "Flutter", "iOS", "Android" | Mobile Engineer (+ PM scoped, Architect scoped if needed) |
| **Custom** | Doesn't fit above patterns | Present skill menu, let user pick |

**Step 2 — Present or skip the plan:**

**Single-skill modes** (Test, Review, Architect, Document, Explore, Design): Skip plan presentation. Classify → invoke immediately. The intent is obvious — no overhead needed.

**Multi-skill modes** (Feature, Harden, Ship, Optimize, Custom): Present the plan for confirmation via notify_user:

```
Here's my plan:

[numbered list of skills and what each does]

Scope: [light / moderate / heavy]

1. **Looks good — start (Recommended)** — Execute this plan
2. **I want the full production-grade pipeline** — Run all 17 skills, 5 phases, 3 gates
3. **Adjust the plan** — Add or remove skills from the plan
4. **Chat about this** — Free-form input
```

**Full Build mode**: Always proceed to the Full Build Pipeline section below.

If the user selects "full pipeline" from any mode, switch to Full Build.

**Step 3 — Execute the mode:**

For non-Full-Build modes, use the lightweight execution flows below. For Full Build, use the Full Build Pipeline.

## Mode Execution (Non-Full-Build)

All modes share these behaviors:
- Bootstrap workspace: `mkdir -p Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.protocols/ Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/`
- Write shared protocols (same as Full Build step 3)
- Read `.production-grade.yaml` for path overrides
- Read existing workspace state if present
- Engagement mode: ask ONLY if mode involves 3+ skills. For 1-2 skill modes, use Standard engagement + Sequential execution.

### Feature Mode

Add a feature to an existing codebase. Lightweight DEFINE → BUILD → TEST.

1. **Codebase scan** — read existing code structure, framework, patterns
2. **PM (Express depth)** — 2-3 questions to scope the feature. Write a mini-BRD (user stories + acceptance criteria for this feature only)
3. **Architect (scoped)** — design how this feature fits the existing architecture. New endpoints, schema changes, component additions. NOT a full system redesign.
4. **Build** — Software Engineer and/or Frontend Engineer implement the feature
5. **Test** — QA writes and runs tests for the new feature
6. **Optional: Review** — Code Reviewer checks the new code against existing patterns

**1 gate:** After PM scoping (step 2), confirm scope before building.

### Harden Mode

Security + quality audit on existing code. No building, pure analysis + fixes.

1. **Codebase scan** — read all existing code
2. **Sequential:** Security Engineer → QA Engineer → Code Reviewer analyze the code
3. **Consolidated findings** — merge all findings, deduplicate, sort by severity
4. **Present findings** — show Critical/High/Medium/Low counts with top issues
5. **Remediation** — fix Critical and High issues (with user confirmation)

**1 gate:** After findings (step 4), before remediation.

### Ship Mode

Get existing code deployed. Infrastructure + reliability.

1. **Codebase scan** — read existing code, identify services, dependencies
2. **DevOps** — Dockerfiles, CI/CD pipelines, IaC (Terraform/Pulumi), monitoring
3. **SRE** — SLO definitions, runbooks, alerting, chaos experiment plan

**1 gate:** After DevOps infra plan, before applying.

### Test Mode

Write tests for existing code. Single skill.

1. Read skills/qa-engineer/SKILL.md and follow its instructions against existing code
2. QA reads code, writes test plan, implements tests, runs them
3. Report results

**0 gates.** QA operates autonomously.

### Review Mode

Code quality review. Single skill, read-only.

1. Read skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md and follow its instructions
2. Review produces findings report
3. Present findings with severity distribution

**0 gates.** Read-only operation.

### Architect Mode

Design or redesign architecture. Single skill.

1. Read skills/solution-architect/SKILL.md and follow its instructions
2. Full discovery interview (depth based on engagement mode)
3. Produces ADRs, diagrams, tech stack, API contracts, scaffold

**1 gate:** Architecture approval before scaffold generation.

### Document Mode

Generate documentation for existing code. Single skill.

1. Read skills/technical-writer/SKILL.md and follow its instructions
2. Reads all code + existing docs
3. Generates API reference, dev guides, architecture overview

**0 gates.** Technical Writer operates autonomously.

### Explore Mode

Thinking partner. Single skill.

1. Read skills/polymath/SKILL.md and follow its instructions
2. Research, advise, ideate — whatever the user needs
3. When ready, offer to hand off to any other mode

**0 gates.** Polymath manages its own dialogue.

### Optimize Mode

Performance + reliability analysis. Two skills.

1. **Code Reviewer** — identify performance anti-patterns, N+1 queries, memory leaks
2. **SRE** — capacity analysis, scaling bottlenecks, SLO evaluation
3. **Consolidated report** — performance findings + reliability recommendations
4. **Remediation** — fix top issues

**1 gate:** After analysis, before fixes.

### Custom Mode

User picks skills from a menu. Present via notify_user:

```
Which skills do you need? (list the numbers separated by commas)

1. **Product Manager** — Requirements, user stories, BRD
2. **Solution Architect** — System design, API contracts, tech stack
3. **Software Engineer** — Backend implementation
4. **Frontend Engineer** — UI components, pages, design system
5. **QA Engineer** — Tests — unit, integration, e2e, performance
6. **Security Engineer** — OWASP audit, STRIDE, vulnerability scan
7. **Code Reviewer** — Architecture conformance, code quality
8. **DevOps** — Docker, CI/CD, Terraform, monitoring
9. **SRE** — SLOs, chaos engineering, runbooks
10. **Technical Writer** — API docs, dev guides, architecture docs
11. **Data Scientist** — LLM optimization, ML pipelines, experiments
12. **Chat about this** — Free-form input
```

Execute selected skills in dependency order. If user picks conflicting skills, resolve via the authority hierarchy.

## Auto-Update Check

Run BEFORE any execution (all modes). Silent if current. One prompt max if update exists.

**Step 0 — version check:**

1. Check current version from plugin metadata
2. Use `read_url_content` to fetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antigravity-code/antigravity-code-production-grade-plugin/main/.antigravity-plugin/plugin.json` → extract `version` (this is the remote version)
3. **If fetch fails** (offline, timeout, 404) → silently continue. Never block the pipeline over an update check.
4. **If remote ≤ local** → continue silently (user sees nothing)
5. **If remote > local** → prompt via notify_user:

```
production-grade v{remote} is available (you have v{local})

1. **Update to v{remote} (Recommended)** — Auto-update and restart pipeline
2. **Skip — continue with v{local}** — Use current version
```

6. **If skip** → continue pipeline with current version
7. **If update** → execute in sequence:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/antigravity-code/antigravity-code-production-grade-plugin.git /tmp/pg-update
   ```
   - Copy updated files to the skills directory
   - Clean up: `rm -rf /tmp/pg-update`
   - Print: `✓ Updated to v{remote_version}. Re-invoke /production-grade to use the new version.`
   - **STOP** — do not continue pipeline. The user must re-invoke to pick up new content.

**If any update step fails**, print a warning and continue with the current version. Never let the updater break the pipeline.

## Full Build Pipeline

When mode is **Full Build**, follow this EXACT sequence:

1. **Print kickoff banner:**
```
━━━ Production Grade Pipeline v{local_version} ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Project: [extracted from user's message]
⧖ Bootstrapping workspace...
```

2. **Bootstrap workspace:**
```bash
mkdir -p Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.protocols/
mkdir -p Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/
```

3. **Write shared protocols** to `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.protocols/`:

| Protocol File | Content |
|---------------|---------|
| `ux-protocol.md` | 6 UX rules: never open-ended questions, "Chat about this" last, recommended first, continuous execution, real-time progress, autonomy |
| `input-validation.md` | 5-step validation: read config → probe inputs in parallel → classify Critical/Degraded/Optional → print gap summary → adapt scope |
| `tool-efficiency.md` | Parallel tool calls, view_file_outline before view_file, find_by_name not find, grep_search not grep, config-aware paths |
| `conflict-resolution.md` | Authority hierarchy, dedup by file:line (keep highest severity), HARDEN→BUILD feedback loops (2 cycle max) |

Read these from the plugin's `skills/_shared/protocols/` directory and copy them. If plugin path is unavailable, write from the summaries above.

4. **Codebase discovery — detect greenfield vs brownfield:**

   Run these scans in parallel:
   ```
   find_by_name("package.json"), find_by_name("go.mod"), find_by_name("pyproject.toml"), find_by_name("Cargo.toml"), find_by_name("pom.xml")
   find_by_name("*", "src/"), find_by_name("*", "services/"), find_by_name("*", "frontend/"), find_by_name("*", "tests/"), find_by_name("*", "docs/")
   find_by_name("Dockerfile*"), find_by_name("*", ".github/workflows/"), find_by_name("*", "infrastructure/"), find_by_name("*", "terraform/")
   find_by_name(".production-grade.yaml")
   ```

   **Classify the project:**

   | Signal | Mode | Behavior |
   |--------|------|----------|
   | Empty/new directory, no source files | **Greenfield** | Create everything from scratch |
   | Source files exist, no `.production-grade.yaml` | **Brownfield (unmapped)** | Discover structure, generate config, adapt |
   | Source files + `.production-grade.yaml` exist | **Brownfield (mapped)** | Use config paths, augment existing code |

   **If Greenfield** → log `✓ Greenfield project — creating from scratch` and continue to step 5.

   **If Brownfield** → run the adaptation sequence:

   a. **Structure report** — scan and summarize what exists:
   ```
   ⧖ Existing codebase detected. Scanning structure...
   Language: [detected from package.json/go.mod/etc.]
   Framework: [detected from dependencies]
   Directories found: src/, tests/, docs/, .github/workflows/
   Files: [N] source files, [N] test files, [N] config files
   ```

   b. **Path mapping** — if no `.production-grade.yaml`, generate one from discovered structure. Notify user via notify_user:

   ```
   I've detected an existing codebase. Here's what I found:

   [structure summary]

   I'll map the pipeline outputs to your existing structure.

   1. **Approve mapping (Recommended)** — Use detected paths, generate .production-grade.yaml
   2. **Customize paths** — Review and adjust the path mapping
   3. **Treat as greenfield** — Ignore existing code, create fresh structure
   4. **Chat about this** — Discuss how the pipeline adapts to your codebase
   ```

   c. **Write `.production-grade.yaml`** from discovered structure — map `paths.*` to actual directories found.

   d. **Set brownfield context** — write to `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/codebase-context.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Codebase Context
   Mode: brownfield
   Language: [detected]
   Framework: [detected]
   Existing paths: [mapping]

   ## Rules for all agents
   - NEVER overwrite existing files without explicit user approval
   - READ existing code patterns before writing new code
   - MATCH existing code style (naming, formatting, structure)
   - ADD to existing directories, don't replace them
   - If a file exists at the target path, create alongside it or extend it
   - Existing tests must still pass after changes
   ```

   All skills read this file before executing. It overrides default "create from scratch" behavior.

5. **Engagement mode:**

Notify user via notify_user:

```
How deeply should the pipeline involve you in decisions?

1. **Standard (Recommended)** — 3 gates + moderate architect interview. Best balance of speed and control.
2. **Express** — Minimal interaction. 3 gates only, auto-derive architecture from BRD. Fastest.
3. **Thorough** — Deep interviews at PM and Architect. Full capacity planning. Review phase summaries.
4. **Meticulous** — Maximum depth. Approve each ADR individually. Review every agent output. Full control.
```

Write the choice to `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/settings.md`:
```markdown
# Pipeline Settings
Engagement: [express|standard|thorough|meticulous]
```

All skills read this file at startup to adapt their depth. The engagement mode controls:
- **PM interview depth** — Express: 2-3 questions. Standard: 3-5. Thorough: 5-8. Meticulous: 8-12.
- **Architect discovery depth** — Express: auto-derive. Standard: 5-7 questions. Thorough: 12-15 with capacity planning. Meticulous: full walkthrough + individual ADR approval.
- **Phase summaries** — Thorough/Meticulous show intermediate outputs between phases.
- **Gate detail** — Meticulous adds per-skill output review at each gate.

5b. **Execution strategy:**

Notify user via notify_user:

```
How should the pipeline execute independent tasks?

1. **Parallel (Recommended for Full Build)** — Independent tasks run in separate git worktrees simultaneously. Faster, uses more resources. Tasks with dependencies still run sequentially.
2. **Sequential** — All tasks run one at a time. Slower but simpler. Best for small projects or debugging.
3. **Chat about this** — Learn more about parallel vs sequential execution.
```

Append to `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/settings.md`:
```markdown
Execution: [parallel|sequential]
Max_Workers: 4
```

When **Parallel** is selected, the BUILD and HARDEN phases use the parallel-dispatch skill (`skills/parallel-dispatch/SKILL.md`) to spawn git worktrees, distribute Task Contracts, and merge results. When **Sequential** is selected, the pipeline behaves as before.

6. **Detect existing workspace** — if `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/` has prior state, offer to resume or restart via notify_user.

7. **Polymath pre-flight check:**
   - If `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/polymath/handoff/context-package.md` exists → read it, pass to PM as pre-loaded context. Log: `✓ Polymath context loaded — skipping redundant discovery`
   - If no polymath context, assess the user's request for knowledge gaps:
     - **Vague scope** (no specific problem domain), **no constraints** (scale, budget, team), **complex domain with no domain language**, **contradictory signals**
     - If gaps detected → read `skills/polymath/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions for pre-flight consultation before proceeding. The polymath will research, clarify with the user, and write a context package when ready.
     - If no gaps → proceed directly. Log: `✓ Request is clear — proceeding to PM`
   - If user explicitly requests to skip polymath ("just build it", clear detailed spec) → proceed immediately.

8. **Research the domain** — use search_web before asking the user anything (skip if polymath already researched).

9. **Create task tracking:**

Create a `task.md` file in `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/` with all 13 tasks and their statuses. Track dependencies and completion.

10. **Begin Phase 1** — read `phases/define.md` and start immediately. Do NOT ask "should I proceed?"

**Key principle:** The user already told you what to build. Research, plan, start building. Pause at the 3 approval gates. In Thorough/Meticulous mode, also show phase summaries between major phases — but never block on them (inform, don't gate).

## User Experience Protocol

Follow the shared UX Protocol at `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.protocols/ux-protocol.md`. Key rules:
1. **NEVER** ask open-ended questions — always use notify_user with predefined numbered options
2. **"Chat about this"** always last option
3. **Recommended option first** with `(Recommended)` suffix
4. **Continuous execution** — work until next gate or completion
5. **Real-time progress** — constant ⧖/✓ progress updates via task_boundary
6. **Autonomy** — sensible defaults, self-resolve, report decisions

### Gate Companion — Polymath Integration

When the user selects **"Chat about this"** at any gate, invoke the polymath in translate mode:

```
Read skills/polymath/SKILL.md and follow its instructions in translate mode.
The polymath reads the gate artifacts, explains in plain language,
answers the user's questions via structured options,
then re-presents the original gate options when the user is ready.
```

This ensures non-technical users can understand what they're approving without the orchestrator needing to be the translator.

### Strategic Gates (3 total)

**Gate 1 — BRD Approval** (after T1):

Notify user via notify_user:
```
BRD complete: [X] user stories, [Y] acceptance criteria. Approve?

1. **Approve — start architecture (Recommended)** — BRD locked, proceed to Solution Architect
2. **Show BRD details** — Display the full BRD before deciding
3. **I have changes** — Request modifications to requirements
4. **Chat about this** — Free-form input about the BRD
```

**Gate 2 — Architecture Approval** (after T2):

Notify user via notify_user:
```
Architecture complete: [tech stack summary]. Approve to start building?

1. **Approve — start building (Recommended)** — Architecture locked, begin autonomous BUILD phase
2. **Show architecture details** — Walk through ADRs, diagrams, and API spec
3. **I have concerns** — Flag issues with architecture decisions
4. **Chat about this** — Free-form input about the architecture
```

**Gate 3 — Production Readiness** (after T9):

Notify user via notify_user:
```
All phases complete. [summary]. Ship it?

1. **Ship it — production ready (Recommended)** — Finalize assembly and deploy
2. **Show full report** — Display complete pipeline summary
3. **Fix issues first** — Address remaining findings before shipping
4. **Chat about this** — Free-form input about production readiness
```

## Task Dependency Graph

Task execution with clear dependency tracking. The orchestrator reads the architecture output (number of services, pages, modules) and generates tasks accordingly. Supports both **sequential** and **parallel** execution based on `settings.md`.

### Sequential Mode (default)
```
T1: product-manager (BRD)
    ↓ [GATE 1]
T2: solution-architect (Architecture)
    ↓ [GATE 2]
T3a: software-engineer — implement backend services (1 per service)
T3b: frontend-engineer — implement frontend pages (1 per page group)
T4a: devops — Dockerfiles + CI skeleton
    ↓ (code written)
T5: qa-engineer — implement tests (unit/integ/e2e/perf)
T6a: security-engineer — STRIDE + code audit + dep scan
T6b: code-reviewer — arch conformance + quality review
    ↓
T7: devops (IaC + CI/CD)
T8: remediation (HARDEN fixes)
T9: sre (SLOs + chaos + capacity)
T10: data-scientist (conditional on AI/ML)
    ↓ [GATE 3]
T11: technical-writer (API ref + dev guides)
T12: skill-maker
    ↓
T13: Compound Learning + Assembly
```

### Parallel Mode
```
T1: product-manager (BRD)
    ↓ [GATE 1]
T2: solution-architect (Architecture)
    ↓ [GATE 2]
    ┌────────────────────── Parallel Group A (BUILD) ─────────────────┐
    │ T3a: software-engineer ──── worktree: .worktrees/T3a           │
    │ T3b: frontend-engineer ──── worktree: .worktrees/T3b           │
    │ T3c: mobile-engineer   ──── worktree: .worktrees/T3c  [cond.] │
    └────────────────── validate → merge → integration test ─────────┘
    T4a: devops (depends on merged T3a output)
    ↓ (code written)
    ┌────────────────────── Parallel Group B (HARDEN) ────────────────┐
    │ T5:  qa-engineer       ──── worktree: .worktrees/T5            │
    │ T6a: security-engineer ──── worktree: .worktrees/T6a           │
    │ T6b: code-reviewer     ──── worktree: .worktrees/T6b           │
    └────────────────── validate → merge → integration test ─────────┘
    ↓
T7: devops (IaC + CI/CD)
T8: remediation (HARDEN fixes)
T9: sre (SLOs + chaos + capacity)
T10: data-scientist (conditional on AI/ML)
    ↓ [GATE 3]
T11: technical-writer (API ref + dev guides)
T12: skill-maker
    ↓
T13: Compound Learning + Assembly
```

When parallel mode is active, the orchestrator reads `skills/parallel-dispatch/SKILL.md` for the dispatch flow.

### Task Dependencies

| Task | Blocked By | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| T1 | — | First task, no blockers |
| T2 | T1 | Needs BRD |
| T3a | T2 | Backend — implement services from architecture |
| T3b | T2 | Frontend — implement pages from BRD |
| T4a | T2 | DevOps — Dockerfiles + CI skeleton |
| T5 | T3a, T3b | QA — needs code + test plan |
| T6a | T3a, T3b | Security — needs code + threat model |
| T6b | T3a, T3b | Review — needs code + checklist |
| T7 | T5, T6a, T6b | IaC + CI/CD — needs HARDEN output |
| T8 | T5, T6a, T6b | Remediation — needs HARDEN findings |
| T9 | T7, T8 | SRE — needs infra + fixes |
| T10 | T7, T8 | Conditional on AI/ML usage |
| T11 | T9 | Docs — needs all prior output |
| T12 | T9 | Skills — needs all prior output |
| T13 | T11, T12 | Final step |

### Dynamic Task Generation

After Gate 2 (architecture approved), the orchestrator reads the architecture output to determine work units:

1. **Count services** — Read `docs/architecture/` service list or `api/` specs. For each service, note it for sequential implementation in T3a.
2. **Count pages** — Read BRD user stories. Group into page clusters (auth, dashboard, settings, etc.). Note for T3b.
3. **Execute sequentially** — Each service and page group is implemented one at a time, reading the SKILL.md for the relevant skill.

### Conditional Tasks

- **T3b (Frontend):** Skip if `.production-grade.yaml` has `features.frontend: false`
- **T10 (Data Scientist):** Auto-detect by scanning for `openai`, `anthropic`, `langchain`, `transformers`, `torch`, `tensorflow` imports. If not detected and `features.ai_ml: false`, mark as completed immediately.

## Phase Execution

Each phase loads its dispatcher file for task management. In parallel mode, BUILD and HARDEN phases additionally invoke the parallel-dispatch skill.

| Phase | File | Tasks | Parallel Support |
|-------|------|-------|------------------|
| DEFINE | `phases/define.md` | T1, T2 | No (gate-protected) |
| BUILD | `phases/build.md` | T3a, T3b, T3c, T4a | Yes (Group A) |
| HARDEN | `phases/harden.md` | T5, T6a, T6b | Yes (Group B) |
| SHIP | `phases/ship.md` | T7, T8, T9, T10 |
| SUSTAIN | `phases/sustain.md` | T11, T12, T13 |

**Read the phase file BEFORE starting that phase. Never load all phase files at once.**

**Internal skill architecture** — each skill's internal phase structure (executed sequentially in Antigravity):

| Skill | Internal Phases |
|-------|----------------|
| software-engineer | Shared foundations first (Phase 2a), then per-service implementation (Phase 2b). Foundations ensure consistency. |
| frontend-engineer | UI Primitives first (Phase 3a), then Layout + Features (Phase 3b), then Pages (Phase 4). Primitives are foundational atoms. |
| qa-engineer | Unit, integration, e2e, performance tests — sequential by test type |
| security-engineer | Code audit, auth review, data security, supply chain — sequential by domain |
| code-reviewer | Architecture conformance, code quality, performance review — sequential by focus |
| devops | IaC, CI/CD, container orchestration — sequential by layer |
| sre | Chaos engineering, incident management, capacity planning — sequential |
| technical-writer | API reference, developer guides — sequential |

### Skill Dispatch Method

Read the skill's SKILL.md file and follow its instructions directly:

```
Read skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md and follow its instructions.
Provide context: architecture files, BRD, workspace paths, etc.
```

## Conflict Resolution

Follow the shared protocol at `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.protocols/conflict-resolution.md`.

| Artifact | Sole Authority | Others Must NOT |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| OWASP, STRIDE, PII, encryption | **security-engineer** | code-reviewer must NOT do security review |
| SLO, error budgets, runbooks | **sre** | devops must NOT define SLOs |
| Code quality, arch conformance | **code-reviewer** | — |
| Infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring setup | **devops** | sre reviews but doesn't provision |
| Requirements (WHAT) | **product-manager** | architect flags gaps, doesn't change requirements |
| Architecture (HOW) | **solution-architect** | — |

### Remediation Feedback Loop

When HARDEN skills find Critical/High issues:
1. Orchestrator creates T8 (Remediation) task with findings
2. Fix code in `services/`, `frontend/`
3. Re-scan affected files after fixes
4. If still failing after **2 cycles** → escalate to user via notify_user

## Context Bridging

## Adaptive Rules

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No frontend needed | Skip T3b, simplify DevOps |
| Monolith architecture | Single Dockerfile, skip K8s/service mesh |
| LLM/ML APIs detected | Auto-enable T10 (Data Scientist) |
| Critical security finding | Create remediation task (T8) |
| QA failures > 20% | Flag to user |
| Architecture drift detected | Warn user (arch decisions are user-approved) |
| `features.frontend: false` | Skip T3b entirely |
| `features.ai_ml: false` | Skip T10 unless auto-detected |

## Security Hooks (Continuous)

Security runs during ALL phases:
- Block `rm -rf /`, `chmod 777`, destructive operations
- Block `.env`, `.key`, `.pem`, `credentials.json` from git
- Scan staged files for API keys, tokens, passwords
- Engineers scan for hardcoded secrets as they write code

## Autonomous Behavior

Every skill execution follows:
1. **Build and verify** — after writing code, run it. After writing tests, execute them.
2. **Validation loop** — `while not valid: fix(errors); validate()`
3. **Self-debug** — read errors, identify root cause. After 3 failures: stop and report.
4. **Quality bar** — no TODOs, no stubs. All code compiles. All tests pass.
5. **TDD enforced** — write test first, watch fail, implement, watch pass, refactor.

## Partial Execution

| Command | Tasks Run |
|---------|----------|
| `just define` | T1, T2 only |
| `just build` | T3a, T3b, T4 (requires T2 output) |
| `just harden` | T5, T6a, T6b (requires BUILD output) |
| `just ship` | T7-T10 (requires HARDEN output) |
| `just document` | T11 only |
| `skip frontend` | Omit T3b |
| `start from architecture` | Skip T1, start at T2 |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Running BUILD without DEFINE | Architecture decisions must exist first |
| Code reviewer doing OWASP review | security-engineer is sole OWASP authority |
| DevOps defining SLOs | sre is sole SLO authority |
| DevOps writing runbooks | sre writes runbooks to docs/runbooks/ |
| Skipping tests | Production grade means tested |
| Not running code after writing | Every skill verifies output compiles and runs |
| Skills working in isolation | Cross-reference via Context Bridging table |
| Over-asking the user | Respect engagement mode. Express: 3 gates only. Standard: 3 gates + moderate interview. Thorough/Meticulous: deeper interviews but always structured options. |
| Ignoring engagement mode | ALL skills must read settings.md and adapt depth. Express architect doesn't ask 15 questions. Meticulous PM doesn't skip to BRD after 2 questions. |
| One-size-fits-all architecture | Architecture is derived from constraints (scale, team, budget, compliance). A 100-user internal tool does NOT need microservices + K8s. |
| Writing stubs | No `// TODO: implement` in production code |
| Hardcoded paths | Read `.production-grade.yaml` for path overrides |
| Not leveraging skill architecture | Even though execution is sequential, each skill's internal phase structure ensures quality. Foundations before dependent work. |
| Duplicating security review | code-reviewer references security-engineer findings |
