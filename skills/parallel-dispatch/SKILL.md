# Parallel Dispatch Orchestrator

## Overview

Manages the parallel execution of independent tasks in the Forge17 pipeline. Uses **git worktrees** for process isolation, **Task Contracts** for explicit input/output boundaries, and **automated validation** to prevent hallucination and ensure clean architecture.

**Max concurrent workers:** 4 (configurable via `MAX_WORKERS` env var)

## When to Use

The production-grade orchestrator invokes this skill when:
1. User selected **Parallel** execution strategy
2. The current phase has **2+ independent tasks** (e.g., BUILD: T3a + T3b + T3c + T4)
3. Execution mode is set to `parallel` in `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/settings.md`

## Parallel Groups

Based on the Forge17 task dependency graph, these groups can run in parallel:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Group A — BUILD Phase (after Gate 2)                │
│   T3a: software-engineer  (services/, libs/)        │
│   T3b: frontend-engineer  (frontend/)               │
│   T3c: mobile-engineer    (mobile/)     [conditional]│
│   T4:  devops             (Dockerfiles) [after T3a] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Group B — HARDEN Phase (after BUILD)                │
│   T5:  qa-engineer        (tests/)                  │
│   T6a: security-engineer  (workspace only)          │
│   T6b: code-reviewer      (workspace only)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Note:** T4 (DevOps) depends on T3a (Backend) for service discovery, so it starts after T3a or runs in a second wave if group size exceeds MAX_WORKERS.

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1 — Dependency Analysis

```
1. Read Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/settings.md
   - Confirm execution: parallel
   - Read engagement mode

2. Read the current phase dispatcher (e.g., phases/build.md)
   - Identify tasks in this phase
   - Check .production-grade.yaml for skip conditions
   - Apply conditional rules (skip frontend if features.frontend: false, etc.)

3. Build execution plan:
   - Wave 1: Tasks with NO inter-dependencies (T3a, T3b, T3c)
   - Wave 2: Tasks depending on Wave 1 output (T4 depends on T3a)
   - If total tasks ≤ MAX_WORKERS: single wave
```

### Phase 2 — Contract Generation

For each task in the execution plan, generate a Task Contract:

```
Read skills/_shared/protocols/task-contract.md for the contract format.

For each task:
1. Determine skill from task ID
2. Determine input files from Context Bridging table (in production-grade/SKILL.md)
3. Determine output directories from the same table
4. Set forbidden writes = all OTHER workers' output directories
5. Set acceptance criteria from skill requirements
6. Write CONTRACT.json

Contract templates by task:

T3a (Backend):
  inputs: api/, schemas/, docs/architecture/, BRD, protocols
  outputs: services/, libs/shared/
  forbidden: frontend/, mobile/, infrastructure/
  tests: must pass

T3b (Frontend):
  inputs: api/, BRD, design tokens, protocols
  outputs: frontend/
  forbidden: services/, mobile/, infrastructure/
  tests: must pass

T3c (Mobile):
  inputs: api/, BRD, design tokens, protocols
  outputs: mobile/
  forbidden: services/, frontend/, infrastructure/
  tests: must pass

T4 (DevOps):
  inputs: services/, docs/architecture/, .production-grade.yaml
  outputs: Dockerfile*, docker-compose.yml
  forbidden: services/*/src/, frontend/src/, mobile/src/
  tests: docker build must succeed

T5 (QA):
  inputs: services/, frontend/, api/, protocols
  outputs: tests/
  forbidden: services/*/src/, frontend/src/
  tests: all tests must execute

T6a (Security):
  inputs: ALL implementation code (read-only)
  outputs: workspace only (Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/security-engineer/)
  forbidden: ALL source code (read-only audit)

T6b (Code Review):
  inputs: ALL implementation + architecture (read-only)
  outputs: workspace only (Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/code-reviewer/)
  forbidden: ALL source code (read-only review)
```

### Phase 3 — Worktree Setup

```
For each task in current wave:
  1. Run: scripts/worktree-manager.sh create <task_id> parallel/<task_id>-<name>
  2. Copy CONTRACT.json into worktree root
  3. Copy readonly input files into worktree (from contract.inputs)
  4. Copy skill SKILL.md into worktree
  5. Verify worktree is ready

Example:
  scripts/worktree-manager.sh create T3a parallel/T3a-backend
  scripts/worktree-manager.sh create T3b parallel/T3b-frontend
  scripts/worktree-manager.sh create T3c parallel/T3c-mobile
```

### Phase 4 — Worker Dispatch

Spawn Gemini CLI instances for each worktree. Each worker runs in its own shell process:

```bash
# For each worktree, spawn a Gemini CLI worker in the background
for task in T3a T3b T3c; do
  worktree_path=".worktrees/${task}"

  # Create worker instruction file
  cat > "${worktree_path}/WORKER_INSTRUCTIONS.md" <<INSTRUCTIONS
  # Worker Instructions for ${task}

  You are a parallel worker in the Forge17 pipeline.

  ## Your Contract
  Read CONTRACT.json in this directory. It defines:
  - What files you CAN read (inputs)
  - What directories you CAN write to (outputs)
  - What you MUST NOT do (constraints)
  - What you MUST deliver (acceptance criteria)

  ## Your Skill
  Read the skill file specified in the contract. Follow its instructions exactly.

  ## Rules
  1. ONLY read files listed in contract inputs
  2. ONLY write files in contract output directories
  3. DO NOT fabricate imports — verify every import path exists
  4. DO NOT create stub code — all code must be fully implemented
  5. Run tests before delivering — all must pass
  6. Write DELIVERY.json when complete (format in contract protocol)

  ## Anti-Hallucination Checklist (run before delivering)
  - [ ] All imports resolve to real files
  - [ ] All API endpoints match the OpenAPI spec
  - [ ] All database models match schema definitions
  - [ ] Type checker passes (tsc/mypy/go vet)
  - [ ] No TODO/FIXME/stub comments in production code
  - [ ] All tests pass

  ## When Done
  Write DELIVERY.json with your results. Do not attempt to merge.
  INSTRUCTIONS

  # Dispatch worker (background process)
  (
    cd "${worktree_path}"
    gemini -p "Read WORKER_INSTRUCTIONS.md and CONTRACT.json, then execute the task following the skill instructions. Work autonomously until complete. Write DELIVERY.json when done." \
      2>&1 | tee "worker-${task}.log"
  ) &

  echo "Worker ${task} dispatched (PID: $!)"
done

# Wait for all workers to complete
wait
echo "All workers completed."
```

**Alternative dispatch (for environments without `gemini` CLI):**

The CEO agent can also dispatch by reading each skill sequentially in separate Antigravity sessions, using the worktree paths as working directories.

### Phase 5 — Result Collection & Validation

After all workers complete:

```
For each task in the wave:
  1. Read DELIVERY.json from worktree
  2. If missing → mark as FAILED
  3. Run: scripts/worktree-manager.sh validate <task_id>
  4. Read skills/_shared/protocols/task-validator.md and execute full validation pipeline
  5. Write VALIDATION.json in the worktree

Status summary:
  ━━━ Parallel Dispatch: Wave 1 Results ━━━━━━━━━━
  T3a (Backend):   ✓ PASS  — 5 services, 42 tests passed
  T3b (Frontend):  ✓ PASS  — 8 pages, 28 tests passed
  T3c (Mobile):    ⊘ SKIP  — not required
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Phase 6 — Merge

Read `skills/_shared/protocols/merge-arbiter.md` and follow merge protocol:

```
1. Merge in dependency order (infrastructure → backend → frontend → mobile)
2. Run post-merge validation after each merge
3. Run full integration test after all merges
4. Log to Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/merge-log.md
5. Clean up worktrees: scripts/worktree-manager.sh cleanup-all
```

### Phase 7 — Wave 2 (if needed)

If there are Wave 2 tasks (e.g., T4 depends on T3a):

```
1. T3a is now merged into main
2. Create new worktrees for Wave 2 tasks
3. These worktrees see T3a's output (it's in main)
4. Repeat Phases 2-6 for Wave 2
```

## Failure Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Worker times out | Kill process, mark FAILED, retry with extended timeout |
| Worker DELIVERY missing | Mark FAILED, retry from checkpoint (WORKER_INSTRUCTIONS + failed context) |
| Validation FAIL (High) | Feed VALIDATION.json back to worker, retry (max 3) |
| Validation FAIL (Critical) | Escalate to CEO agent immediately |
| Merge conflict (auto-resolvable) | Apply auto-resolution per merge-arbiter.md |
| Merge conflict (code) | Escalate to CEO agent |
| Integration test failure | Identify culprit branch, revert, re-dispatch |
| All retries exhausted | Fall back to sequential mode for the failed task |

## Checkpoint & Resume

Each worker's state is preserved in its worktree:

```
.worktrees/T3a/
├── CONTRACT.json            # Input contract (immutable)
├── WORKER_INSTRUCTIONS.md   # Dispatch instructions
├── DELIVERY.json            # Worker output (written by worker)
├── VALIDATION.json          # Validation results (written by validator)
├── worker-T3a.log           # Worker stdout/stderr
└── services/                # Actual work output
```

To resume a failed task:
```bash
scripts/worktree-manager.sh resume T3a
# Worker re-reads CONTRACT.json + VALIDATION.json feedback
# Fixes issues and regenerates DELIVERY.json
```

## Progress Tracking

Update `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/task.md` with parallel status:

```markdown
## BUILD Phase (Parallel)
- [x] T3a: Backend Engineering — ✓ 5 services (Wave 1)
- [x] T3b: Frontend Engineering — ✓ 8 pages (Wave 1)
- [⊘] T3c: Mobile Engineering — skipped (not required)
- [x] T4: DevOps Containers — ✓ 5 Dockerfiles (Wave 2)
- [x] Merge — ✓ all branches merged, integration tests pass
```

## Security Notes

- Each worktree is isolated — workers cannot read each other's output
- Forbidden writes are enforced by validation, not filesystem permissions
- All worker processes run with the same user credentials
- No network isolation between workers (they may all need package registries)
- Secrets/credentials should NOT be in any contract input
