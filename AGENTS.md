# Forge17 — Production Grade AI Pipeline

> **This file is read by Antigravity on every new chat.** It tells the AI assistant how to use Forge17's 47 specialized skills.

## What is Forge17?

Forge17 is an adaptive orchestrator with **47 AI skills** that covers the entire software development lifecycle **plus game development, XR, data engineering, and MLOps**. From a single code review to a full Unity/Unreal/Godot/Roblox game build, it routes to the right skills automatically. Supports **parallel execution** via git worktrees for faster builds.

**Pipeline:** `DEFINE → BUILD → HARDEN → SHIP → SUSTAIN`

## How to Use (For Every New Chat)

**IMPORTANT:** When the user gives any software development request, you MUST:

1. **Read `skills/production-grade/SKILL.md`** — this is the orchestrator that routes to all skills
2. **Classify the request** into one of 19 modes (Full Build, Feature, Harden, Ship, Test, Review, Architect, Document, Explore, Research, Optimize, Design, Mobile, Mobile Test, Marketing, Grow, **Game Build**, **XR Build**, **Analyze**)
3. **Follow the pipeline** as defined in the orchestrator

Do NOT skip the orchestrator. Do NOT try to handle requests directly. Let the production-grade skill classify and route.

## Quick Reference

## Available Workflows

Users can invoke these workflows directly:
- `/setup` — First-time setup as git submodule
- `/update` — Check for and install updates
- `/pipeline` — Show full pipeline reference and available modes
- `/setup-mobile-test` — Set up plug-and-play mobile testing (Android/iOS)
- `/onboard` — Run deep project analysis (creates `.forge17/project-profile.json`)

## Auto-Update Check

At the start of each session, silently check if a newer version is available:

```
Current version: read VERSION file
Remote version: compare with https://github.com/buiphucminhtam/forgewright
```

If a newer version exists, mention it briefly: *"Forge17 update available (vX.X.X → vY.Y.Y). Run `/update` to upgrade."*
