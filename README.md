## Quick Start

### Option A: One-liner Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# macOS/Linux — download & install as git submodule
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antigravity-code/antigravity-code-production-grade-plugin/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh install

# Windows (PowerShell)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antigravity-code/antigravity-code-production-grade-plugin/main/setup.ps1" -OutFile "setup.ps1"
.\setup.ps1 install
```

### Option B: Manual Git Submodule

```bash
git submodule add -b main https://github.com/antigravity-code/antigravity-code-production-grade-plugin.git .antigravity/plugins/production-grade
git add .gitmodules .antigravity/ && git commit -m "feat: add production-grade plugin v5.1"
```

### Option C: Standalone Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antigravity-code/antigravity-code-production-grade-plugin.git
```

Then say: *"Build a production-grade SaaS for [your idea]"* — or *"Help me think about [your idea]"* if you want the Polymath co-pilot first.

### Updating

```bash
# With setup script
./setup.sh update          # macOS/Linux
.\setup.ps1 update         # Windows

# Manual submodule update
git submodule update --remote .antigravity/plugins/production-grade
git add .antigravity/ && git commit -m "chore: update production-grade plugin"

# Standalone clone
git pull
```

### Team Collaboration

When your project uses the submodule, teammates just run:

```bash
# First time cloning your project
git clone --recurse-submodules <your-project-url>

# Or if already cloned
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Why This Exists

Software development with AI today is broken in a specific way: **AI is fast at generating code, but slow at understanding what to generate.** You prompt, you get code, it's wrong, you re-prompt, you get different wrong code. The bottleneck isn't generation — it's alignment.

**Production Grade solves both sides:**
1. A **Polymath co-pilot** that thinks with you — researches your domain, detects your knowledge gaps, helps you crystallize the idea before committing to code
2. A **17-agent autonomous pipeline** that executes the full software development lifecycle — from requirements to deployment — without you managing the process

The result: you describe what you want in plain language. 17 specialized skills research, design, build, test, secure, deploy, and document a complete production system. You approve 3 times. That's it.

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **17 specialized skills** | Each with sole authority over its domain — no overlap, no contradiction |
| **12 execution modes** | Full Build, Feature, Harden, Ship, Test, Review, Architect, Document, Explore, Optimize, Design, Mobile |
| **3 approval gates** | Everything between gates is fully autonomous |
| **4 shared protocols** | UX, input validation, tool efficiency, conflict resolution |
| **6 Polymath modes** | Onboard, research, ideate (with structured brainstorming), advise, translate, synthesize |
| **4 engagement modes** | Express, Standard, Thorough, Meticulous — choose your interaction depth |
| **0 open-ended questions** | Every user interaction is structured with numbered options |

## Skill Strengths & Capabilities

### 17 Bundled Skills

| # | Skill | Strengths | Key Capabilities |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0 | **polymath** | Creative partner, not just executor | Research, ideate (SCAMPER, Six Hats, HMW, Crazy 8s), advise, onboard, translate, synthesize |
| 1 | **production-grade** | Smart routing, minimal overhead | 12 execution modes, auto-classifies request, dependency-based task graph |
| 2 | **product-manager** | Deep requirement discovery | CEO interview, domain research via web search, BRD with user stories |
| 3 | **solution-architect** | Scale-driven decisions | ADRs, API contracts (OpenAPI 3.1), data models, fitness interview, scaffold generation |
| 4 | **software-engineer** | TDD-first, clean architecture | Handlers → services → repositories, strict TDD cycle, cross-cutting concerns |
| 5 | **frontend-engineer** | Design system + a11y | Component library, pages, API integration, WCAG compliance, responsive design |
| 6 | **qa-engineer** | Full testing pyramid + browser automation | Unit, integration, E2E, **Playwright** (visual regression, multi-viewport, a11y scanning), performance (k6) |
| 7 | **security-engineer** | Sole OWASP/STRIDE authority | Threat modeling, code audit, auth/authz, PII detection, dependency scanning |
| 8 | **code-reviewer** | Architecture conformance | Quality analysis, performance review, read-only (no code changes) |
| 9 | **devops** | End-to-end infrastructure | Docker, Terraform, CI/CD, monitoring, **branch strategy** (trunk-based/gitflow), Conventional Commits |
| 10 | **sre** | Sole SLO authority | SLOs, error budgets, chaos engineering, runbooks, capacity planning |
| 11 | **data-scientist** | AI/ML lifecycle management | LLM optimization, A/B testing, data pipelines, cost modeling, **prompt engineering** (eval harness, guardrails) |
| 12 | **technical-writer** | Automated doc generation | API reference, developer guides, Docusaurus scaffold, **changelog generation** (Conventional Commits) |
| 13 | **skill-maker** | Self-extending system | Generates 3-5 project-specific custom skills based on domain needs |
| 14 | **ui-designer** ⭐ NEW | Design-first approach | Design brief, color palettes, typography scale, wireframes, component inventory, interaction patterns, a11y guidelines |
| 15 | **mobile-engineer** ⭐ NEW | Cross-platform native feel | React Native (Expo) / Flutter, navigation, native integrations (push, biometric, camera), app store prep |

> **⭐ v5.1 Highlights:** `ui-designer` produces design tokens that `frontend-engineer` and `mobile-engineer` consume. `mobile-engineer` is conditional — only activates when BRD mentions mobile requirements.

### Token-Efficient Architecture

Large skills use a router + on-demand phase pattern. Only the relevant phase loads.

| Skill | Phases |
|-------|--------|
| `polymath` | 6 modes: onboard, research, ideate (+ SCAMPER, Six Hats, HMW, Crazy 8s), advise, translate, synthesize |
| `software-engineer` | 5 phases: context, implementation, cross-cutting, integration, local dev |
| `frontend-engineer` | 5 phases: analysis, design system, components, pages, testing/a11y |
| `security-engineer` | 6 phases: threat model, code audit, auth, data, supply chain, remediation |
| `sre` | 5 phases: readiness, SLOs, chaos, incidents, capacity |
| `data-scientist` | 7 phases: audit, LLM optimization, experiments, pipeline, ML infra, cost, **prompt engineering** |
| `technical-writer` | 5 phases: audit, API reference, dev guides, Docusaurus, **changelog** |
| `ui-designer` ⭐ | 4 phases: UX research, design tokens, wireframes, component inventory |
| `mobile-engineer` ⭐ | 5 phases: platform analysis, navigation, screens (parallel), native integration, build/store prep |

## Integration Guide

### Setup Scripts

| Platform | Install | Update | Status | Uninstall |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **macOS/Linux** | `./setup.sh install` | `./setup.sh update` | `./setup.sh status` | `./setup.sh uninstall` |
| **Windows** | `.\setup.ps1 install` | `.\setup.ps1 update` | `.\setup.ps1 status` | `.\setup.ps1 uninstall` |

**Requirements:** Antigravity, Docker & Docker Compose, Git.

### Zero Config

Works out of the box. The orchestrator auto-detects your project structure and makes sensible defaults.

### Custom Config (`.production-grade.yaml`)

For existing projects or specific preferences:

```yaml
version: "5.1"

project:
  name: "my-project"
  language: "typescript"        # typescript | go | python | rust | java
  framework: "nestjs"           # nestjs | express | fastapi | gin | actix | spring
  cloud: "aws"                  # aws | gcp | azure
  architecture: "microservices" # monolith | modular-monolith | microservices

paths:
  services: "services/"
  frontend: "frontend/"
  mobile: "mobile/"             # NEW — mobile app directory
  tests: "tests/"
  terraform: "infrastructure/terraform/"
  ci_cd: ".github/workflows/"
  docs: "docs/"

preferences:
  test_framework: "jest"
  orm: "prisma"
  package_manager: "npm"
  frontend_framework: "nextjs"
  mobile_framework: "react-native"  # NEW — react-native | flutter

features:
  frontend: true
  mobile: false                 # NEW — auto-detected from BRD or set explicitly
  ui_design: true               # NEW — set to false for backend-only projects
  ai_ml: false                  # auto-detected from imports
  multi_tenancy: true
  documentation_site: true
```

### Partial Execution

Don't need the full pipeline? Run what you need:

| Command | What Runs |
|---------|-----------|
| `"Just define"` | PM + UI Designer + Architect only |
| `"Just build"` | Backend + Frontend + Mobile + Containers |
| `"Just harden"` | QA + Security + Code Review |
| `"Just ship"` | IaC + CI/CD + SRE |
| `"Just document"` | Technical Writer + Changelog |
| `"Help me think about..."` | Polymath only (exploration, research, advice) |
| `"Onboard me on this repo"` | Polymath onboard mode |
| `"Design UI for..."` | UI Designer only |
| `"Build mobile app for..."` | Mobile Engineer (+ PM, Architect if needed) |
| `"Skip frontend"` | Full pipeline minus frontend |
| `"Skip mobile"` | Full pipeline minus mobile |

### Brownfield Workflow (Existing Projects)

1. Create `.production-grade.yaml` to map your existing paths
2. Skills detect existing code and **extend, don't replace**
3. Run specific modes: `"harden"`, `"add feature"`, `"write tests"`, `"document"`
4. Workspace artifacts go to `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/` — your code stays untouched

## Known Limitations & Important Notes

### ⚠️ Limitations

| Area | Limitation | Workaround |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Mobile testing** | No automated mobile device testing (physical/emulator) in CI | Manual testing on real devices required; CI covers unit/integration only |
| **Visual design** | UI Designer produces text-based specs, not Figma/Sketch files | Use specs to build in your preferred design tool, or feed directly to frontend-engineer |
| **Playwright** | Playwright tests require browsers installed in CI environment | Use Playwright's Docker image or CI browser caching (documented in qa-engineer Phase 5b) |
| **Prompt engineering** | LLM-as-judge eval requires additional API calls and cost | Budget for eval API calls; use exact-match/schema-valid metrics where possible |
| **Changelog** | Requires Conventional Commits format in git history | Retrofit with `git rebase -i` or start fresh with commit-lint enforcement |
| **App stores** | Plugin generates submission docs, not actual submissions | Manual App Store Connect / Play Console submission required |
| **Flutter support** | Mobile engineer covers both RN and Flutter, but examples lean React Native | Explicitly set `mobile_framework: "flutter"` in config for Flutter-first output |
| **Token budget** | Full 17-skill pipeline on large projects may hit context limits | Use engagement mode "Express" for autonomous execution; phases load on demand |
| **No database migration runner** | Schema designs are generated but migrations aren't executed | Run generated SQL/migration files manually or integrate with your ORM's migration tool |

### 📋 Important Notes

1. **Conditional skills save tokens** — `mobile-engineer`, `data-scientist`, and `ui-designer` only activate when needed. Backend-only APIs skip all three automatically.

2. **Design tokens flow downstream** — The `ui-designer` generates `docs/design/design-tokens.json` which `frontend-engineer` and `mobile-engineer` consume. If you skip UI design, these skills use sensible defaults.

3. **Branch strategy depends on DevOps phase** — The new branch strategy section in `devops` recommends Trunk-Based Development by default. Override in config if your team uses Gitflow.

4. **Changelog requires git history** — The new changelog phase reads `git log`. On fresh repos with no history, it generates a template instead.

5. **Prompt engineering is deep** — Phase 7 of `data-scientist` includes eval harness, A/B testing, and guardrails. For simple LLM usage, Phase 2 (LLM Optimization) may be sufficient.

6. **Engagement modes apply per-skill** — Express mode runs ALL skills autonomously. Standard surfaces 1-2 decisions per skill. For new users, start with Standard.

7. **Authority hierarchy is strict** — Security engineer owns OWASP (code reviewer must not do security review). SRE owns SLOs (devops must not define them). UI Designer owns design tokens (frontend must consume, not replace).

8. **Workspace artifacts are separate from your code** — All skill workspace outputs go to `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/`. Your source code directories (`services/`, `frontend/`, `mobile/`) contain only production code.

## Conflict Resolution

Each domain has one authority. No overlap, no contradictions.

| Domain | Authority | Others Must Not |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| OWASP, STRIDE, PII | **security-engineer** | code-reviewer skips security |
| SLOs, error budgets, runbooks | **sre** | devops skips SLO definitions |
| Code quality, arch conformance | **code-reviewer** | produces findings only, no code changes |
| Infrastructure, CI/CD | **devops** | sre reviews but doesn't provision |
| Requirements | **product-manager** | architect flags gaps, doesn't change requirements |
| Architecture | **solution-architect** | implementation follows, doesn't redesign |
| Design tokens, UX patterns | **ui-designer** | frontend/mobile consumes, doesn't replace |
| Prompt quality, LLM guardrails | **data-scientist** | other skills don't modify prompts directly |

## FAQ

**Does it write working code?**
Yes. Every skill: write, build, test, debug, fix. No stubs. No TODOs. Code that compiles and runs.

**Can I use it if I'm not technical?**
Yes. The Polymath co-pilot translates everything into plain language. Every interaction uses numbered options. You never need to know the right technical terms.

**Can I use it on existing projects?**
Yes. Create `.production-grade.yaml` to map your paths, then run specific phases or the full pipeline.

**What languages are supported?**
TypeScript/Node.js, Go, Python, Rust, Java/Kotlin. Mobile: React Native (Expo) or Flutter.

**Will it overwrite my existing code?**
No. Deliverables go to defined directories. Workspace artifacts stay in `Antigravity-Production-Grade-Suite/`.

**Do I need all 17 skills?**
No. The orchestrator only activates the skills you need. A backend API project may use only 8-10 skills. A full-stack mobile app might use all 17.

**How does the UI Designer work without Figma?**
It produces detailed text-based design specs: color palettes with exact hex/HSL values, typography scales, spacing systems, component inventories with state matrices, and wireframe descriptions with responsive breakpoints. The frontend/mobile engineer consumes these specs directly.

**Is Playwright required for testing?**
No. Playwright is an optional addition to the QA engineer (Phase 5b). Traditional unit, integration, and API tests run without it. Add Playwright when you need browser automation, visual regression, or accessibility scanning.

**How is state managed?**
Via `task.md` tracking files in the workspace. No custom state management needed.
